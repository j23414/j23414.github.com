    <h2>History of S and R programming languages</h2>

    <p>
      As a rule, when a programmer needs something, he/she programs it. Creating a
      form of artificial life that requires you and your computer, and occasionally
      lots of coffee. Sometimes these programs can be almost beautifully simple,
      and (user) friendly. Others look more like monsters, ripping us apart until
      we finally delete or abandon them in frustration.
    </p>

    <p>
      What causes some software to live, multiplying like rabbits, and some to
      die quietly in a corner on the creators file system? An example of a
      successful case can be found in the article “From S to R: 35 Years of AT&T
      Leadership in Statistical Computing.” The writers focus on data analysis
      but the principles should be taught in any software development course.

<p>
  One, software must be beautifully useful. I say “beautifully useful” because
  there are plenty of programs that are “useful” but so frustratingly difficult
  to use that few would-be-users if any get over the initial learning barrier.
  During the development of S in the 1970’s, Becker and Chambers put some thought
  into designing a programming language and environment that was statistician
  friendly during a time of engineering-centric programming and data-type
  dependence. As a result, S was based entirely on functions. These functions
  were applied to vectors of data, regardless of data type. S functions were
  run line by line (similar to terminal) where results and intermittent results
  were immediately available and debuggable. What was once heavy duty and slow
  became incremental and fast. The heavy duty tools of data analysis became toys
  in a playground of data exploration.
</p>

<p>
  Two, software must be easily distributed. In some ways, I think the initial
  developers of S were lucky. They were able to catch the Unix wave just when
  it was freely and therefore widely available. Anyone who downloaded Unix could
  start learning S. R showed up when S was no longer free.
</p>

<p>
  Three, software must be extendible. In my opinion, a component of the success
  of Amazon and YouTube are because of their user-generated content. For each
  product on Amazon or each video on YouTube, comments create user buy-in. The
  platform is an interactive experience where the users create content and develop
  into a loyal community. In the same way, software also creates a type of community.
  Instead of content, users are generating packages or extensions. There are online
  forums to post bug reports or suggestions for new features. There are new packages
  to download, try out, and critique. The foundation of the software (core) must
  be strong enough to withstand the edits of the masses each developing and
  customizing according to their own needs. This endless customization keeps the
  tool relevant to today’s problems. The software grows like some strange ameba,
  stretching out arms in different directions, engulfing certain functions and
  expelling others. A type of evolutionary growth as what is useful is kept and
  what is not withers away.
</p>

<p>
  These three points create a piece of software that is self sustaining. A well
  thought out design sets the stage/environment for the growth of a community of
  users invested in a tool to continue development, continue improvement and
  eventually create results never before imagined.
