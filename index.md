This portfolio links to some of my programming projects, of which many have required cups and cups of coffee. I have a PhD in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology from Iowa State University. I have been programming (in one language or another) since 2006 and I am interested in writing practical and intuitive tools for data analysis and visualization. My specialization is network analysis and my PhD Project, the Mango Graph Studio software, has been licensed to a startup. I am currently working as an ORISE Postdoctoral Fellow at USDA-ARS on Influenza A viruses.
