Jennifer Chang grew up in northern Wisconsin and has been programming (in one language or another) since 2006. At <a href="https://www.cornellcollege.edu" target="_blank">Cornell College</a>, she double majored in Biochemistry and Computer Science graduating in 2011. In 2017, Jennifer earned a PhD in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology from <a href="https://www.bcb.iastate.edu/" target="_blank">Iowa State University</a>. During the PhD, her research software "Mango Graph Studio" led to co-founding a <a href="https://www.complexcomputation.com/en/" target="_blank">software company</a> and working on two Department of Defense SBIR contracts. She eventually left the company and was an <a href="https://orise.orau.gov/usda-ars/about-orise/index.html" target="_blank">ORISE USDA-ARS postdoc</a> with Dr. Amy Vincent and automated the swine influenza reports from 2017-2020. In June 2020, Jennifer shifted to the current SCINet postdoc position with Dr. Andrew Severin and Dr. Brian Scheffler where she collaborates on the <a href="https://bioinformaticsworkbook.org" target="_blank">bioinformatic workbook</a>. She's still in Ames, Iowa, learning slurm and automating pipelines for different hardware architectures. She hopes to write flexible-general-purpose pipelines that reduce tedium and increase joy of discovery. Jennifer cares about collaboration, welcoming environments, and teaching.

<!-- This portfolio links to some of my programming projects, of which many have required cups and cups of coffee. I have a PhD in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology from Iowa State University. I grew up in northern Wisconsin and have been programming (in one language or another) since 2006. I am interested in writing practical and intuitive tools for data analysis and visualization. My specialization is network analysis and my PhD Project, the Mango Graph Studio software, has been licensed to a startup. I am currently working as an ORISE Postdoctoral Fellow at USDA-ARS on Influenza A viruses. -->
